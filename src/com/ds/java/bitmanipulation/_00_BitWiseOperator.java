	//Bitwise AND Operator & - If both corresponding bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, the resulting bit is 0.
	//Bitwise OR Operator  | -  If either corresponding bit is 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, the resulting bit is 0.
	//XOR Operator ^ -  If the number of 1s in corresponding bit positions is odd, the resulting bit is 1; if even, the resulting bit is 0.
	//NOT Operator  - flips all the bits in the number.
	//Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right, discarding the bits that fall off and filling the leftmost bits with zeros.
	  //13 >> 1 = 1101 >> 1 = 0110 (binary of 6) (Divide by 2 )
	// Left Shift (<<) : Shifts the bits to the left, discarding the bits that fall off and filling the rightmost bits with zeros.
	   //13 << 1 = 1101 << 1 = 11010 (binary of 26) (multiply * 2)
